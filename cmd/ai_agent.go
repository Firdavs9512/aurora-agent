// Package cmd provides command-line functionality for the Aurora Agent
package cmd

// This file serves as an entry point for the AI agent functionality.
// The implementation has been split into multiple files for better organization:
//
// - types.go: Contains type definitions and interfaces
// - openai_agent.go: Contains the OpenAI agent implementation
// - agent_manager.go: Contains the agent manager implementation
//
// This modular approach improves code readability and maintainability.
